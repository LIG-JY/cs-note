## 1) Run `process-run.py` with the following flags:-l 5:100,5:100. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this?

```shell
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  4        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  5        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  6           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
  7           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
  8           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
  9           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 10           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          

Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 10 (100.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  0 (0.00%)

```

- CPU utilization: 100%

Both processes are designed to exclusively use the CPU. Each process has 5 instruction and the probability of each
instruction using the CPU is 100%
They use the cpu in that order. There are no idel time.

## 2) Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes?

```shell
gyo ~/Desktop  $ python3 ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -p -c
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  4        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  5           DONE        RUN:io             1          
  6           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  7           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  8           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
  9           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
 10           DONE       BLOCKED                           1
 11*          DONE   RUN:io_done             1          

Stats: Total Time 11
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (54.55%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (45.45%)
```

- Time: 11

By default, I/O takes 5 time.

## 3) Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why?

```shell
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1          

Stats: Total Time 7
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (85.71%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (71.43%)

```

- Time: 7

IO operations are happening for 5 time units, but this doesn’t impact the CPU as Process 1 can
use the CPU while Process 0 waits for IO completion.

This results in an increase in CPU utilization and a decrease in overall execution time.

**Scheduling** allows the CPU to switch between processes, ensuring that the CPU doesn’t sit idle when one process is
blocked. This is a fundamental concept of process scheduling in operating systems, where tasks are managed efficiently
to maximize resource utilization.

## 4) We’ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`, one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

```shell
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  3        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  4        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  5        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  6        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done         READY             1          
  8           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
  9           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 10           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          
 11           DONE       RUN:cpu             1          

Stats: Total Time 11
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (54.55%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (45.45%)

```

This results in a decrease in CPU utilization and an increase in overall execution time.

## 5) Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`. What happens now? Use-c and -p to confirm that you are right.

```shell
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1          
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1          

Stats: Total Time 7
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (85.71%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (71.43%)

```

Same result as 3)

## 6) One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER` Are system resources being effectively utilized?

```shell
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1        PID: 2        PID: 3           CPU           IOs

- Resource aren't being effectively utilized
    - CPU-bound processes dominate: Because the CPU-bound processes (with 100% CPU usage) are
      prioritized(`IO_RUN_LATER`) and run for an
      extended period, the process that initiated the IO (PID 0) has to wait longer to execute again, even after its IO
      completes.

    - Idle IO resource: The IO system becomes idle during the periods(Time 7 ~ Time 17) where CPU-bound processes are
      dominating the CPU.
      Although CPU is being utilized, IO is underutilized for significant portions of the simulation.

The processes in the list provided with the -l (PROCESS_LIST) option are assigned sequential numbers starting from 0.

The process with PID 0 is always executed first.

PID 0 performs an IO operation and enters a blocked state for 5 time units.

When PID0 is in block state, PID 1 executes the instructions due to CPU scheduling. (because of `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` )

Because of `IO_RUN_LATER` PID 2 run at time 7. After the IO operation completes, the process is not executed
immediately, but is scheduled to run later so that other processes can run first.

Run the remaining io task commands after all non-I/O tasks have finished. (Time 17)

## 7) Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

- When there are many CPU-bound processes and fewer IO-bound processes, prioritizing the IO-bound tasks by immediately
  running the process that completed an I/O helps optimize resource utilization.

The process with PID 0 is always executed first.

PID 0 performs an IO operation and enters a blocked state for 5 time units.

When PID0 is in block state, PID 1 executes the instructions due to CPU scheduling. (because of `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` )

Because of `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` when an I/O completes, the process(PID 0) that issued it is run right away. (Time 7: first
I/O instruction done, Time 8: second I/O instruction start)

The rest of the processes(PID 2, PID 3) are also scheduled to use the CPU during I/O operations on PID 0.

## 8) Now run with some randomly generated processes using flags `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` versus that flag `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use the flag `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` versus `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

### Seed1

#### Scenario 1

- PID 0: 2 I/O-bound instructions, 1 CPU-bound instruction.
- PID 1: 3 CPU-bound instructions

When PID 0's I/O-bound instruction start all PID 2's instructions are executed. because of CPU scheduling by OS.

```

Context switch at the end of an I/O operation. resource utilization has decreased.

### Seed 1 conclusion

- total I/O bound instruction 2, total CPU bound instruction 4
- the most efficient scheduling would be:
    1. Switching to another process during IO operations (so the CPU-bound process can use the CPU while the IO-bound
       process waits).
    2. Immediately starting another IO operation as soon as one finishes, keeping the IO system busy while also
       utilizing the CPU.

- Because IO operations are relatively fewer, it becomes important to ensure that IO devices don’t stay idle while there
  are CPU-bound tasks that can still be processed.

- PID 0: 2 I/O bound instructions, 1 CPU-bound instruction.
- PID 1: 2 I/O bound instructions, 1 CPU-bound instruction.
- With `SWITCH_ON_IO` is the best scenario.
- Time 3: RUN:io for PID 1
    - due to the `SWITCH_ON_IO` flag

```

- total I/O bound instruction 4, total CPU bound instruction 2
- the most efficient scheduling would be:
    1. Switching to another process during IO operations (so the CPU-bound process can use the CPU while the IO-bound
       process waits).

- Because of the relatively large number of IO operations, CPU-bound operations must be handled during I/O operations.
